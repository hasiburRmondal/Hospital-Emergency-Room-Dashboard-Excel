ðŸš‘ Hospital Emergency Room Analysis Dashboard | Power BI Project ðŸ“Š

I created a dynamic Emergency Room Analysis Dashboard using Power BI to help healthcare teams improve efficiency, monitor patient flow, and enhance decision-making.

Key insights included: âœ… Patient Admission Status â€” Track how many patients were admitted vs. not admitted
âœ… Patient Age Distribution â€” Visualize patient groups by age brackets
âœ… Timeliness of Care â€” Measure the percentage of patients seen within 30 minutes
âœ… Gender Analysis â€” Display the number of patients by gender
âœ… Department Referrals â€” Identify which departments patients are referred to the most

This project showcases how data visualization can uncover critical patterns, optimize resource allocation, and ultimately improve emergency room services.
